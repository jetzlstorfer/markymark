## Onboard first microservice
Duration: 8:00

After creating the project, services can be onboard to this project.

* Onboard the **carts** service using the [keptn onboard service](../../reference/cli/#keptn-onboard-service) command:

```console
keptn onboard service carts --project=sockshop --chart=./carts
```

* After onboarding the service, tests (i.e., functional- and performance tests) need to be added as basis for quality gates in the different stages:

  * Functional tests for *dev* stage:

    ```console
    keptn add-resource --project=sockshop --stage=dev --service=carts --resource=jmeter/basiccheck.jmx --resourceUri=jmeter/basiccheck.jmx
    ```

  * Performance tests for *staging* stage:

    ```console
    keptn add-resource --project=sockshop --stage=staging --service=carts --resource=jmeter/load.jmx --resourceUri=jmeter/load.jmx
    ```

    **Note:** You can adapt the tests in `basiccheck.jmx` as well as `load.jmx` for your service. However, you must not rename the files because there is a hardcoded dependency on these file names in the current implementation of Keptn's jmeter-service. 

Since the carts service requires a mongodb database, a second service needs to be onboarded.

* Onboard the **carts-db** service using the [keptn onboard service](../../reference/cli/#keptn-onboard-service) command. The `--deployment-strategy` flag specifies that for this service a *direct* deployment strategy in all stages should be used regardless of the deployment strategy specified in the shipyard. Thus, the database is not blue/green deployed.

```console
keptn onboard service carts-db --project=sockshop --chart=./carts-db --deployment-strategy=direct
```

During the onboarding of the services, Keptn creates a namespace for each stage based on the pattern: `projectname-stagename`.

* To verify the new namespaces, execute the following command:

```console
kubectl get namespaces
```

```console
NAME                  STATUS   AGE
...
sockshop-dev          Active   2m16s
sockshop-production   Active   2m16s
sockshop-staging      Active   2m16s
```

## Deploy first build with Keptn 
Duration: 5:00

After onboarding the services, a built artifact of each service can be deployed.

* Deploy the carts-db service by executing the [keptn send event new-artifact](../../reference/cli/#keptn-send-event-new-artifact) command:

```console
keptn send event new-artifact --project=sockshop --service=carts-db --image=docker.io/mongo --tag=4.2.2
```

* Deploy the carts service by specifying the built artifact, which is stored on DockerHub and tagged with version 0.10.1:

```console
keptn send event new-artifact --project=sockshop --service=carts --image=docker.io/keptnexamples/carts --tag=0.10.1
```

* Go to Keptn's Bridge and check which events have already been generated. You can access it by a port-forward from your local machine to the Kubernetes cluster:

```console 
kubectl port-forward svc/bridge -n keptn 9000:8080
```

* The Keptn's Bridge is then available on: http://localhost:9000. 

    It shows all deployments that have been triggered. On the left-hand side, you can see the deployment start events (i.e., so-called `Configuration change` events). During a deployment, Keptn generates events for controlling the deployment process. These events will also show up in Keptn's Bridge. Please note that if events are sent at the same time, their order in the Keptn's Bridge might be arbitrary since they are sorted on the granularity of one second.

* **Optional:** Verify the pods that should have been created for services carts and carts-db:

```console
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep carts
```

```console
sockshop-dev          carts-77dfdc664b-25b74                            1/1     Running     0          10m
sockshop-dev          carts-db-54d9b6775-lmhf6                          1/1     Running     0          13m
sockshop-production   carts-db-54d9b6775-4hlwn                          2/2     Running     0          12m
sockshop-production   carts-primary-79bcc7c99f-bwdhg                    2/2     Running     0          2m15s
sockshop-staging      carts-db-54d9b6775-rm8rw                          2/2     Running     0          12m
sockshop-staging      carts-primary-79bcc7c99f-mbbgq                    2/2     Running     0          7m24s
```

## View carts service
Duration: 2:00

- Get the URL for your carts service with the following commands in the respective namespaces:

```console
echo http://carts.sockshop-dev.$(kubectl get cm keptn-domain -n keptn -o=jsonpath='{.data.app_domain}')
```

```console
echo http://carts.sockshop-staging.$(kubectl get cm keptn-domain -n keptn -o=jsonpath='{.data.app_domain}')
```

```console
echo http://carts.sockshop-production.$(kubectl get cm keptn-domain -n keptn -o=jsonpath='{.data.app_domain}')
```

- Navigate to the URLs to inspect the carts service. In the production namespace, you should receive an output similar to this:
