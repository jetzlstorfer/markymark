## Create first project
Duration: 8:00

For creating a project, this tutorial relies on the `shipyard.yaml` file shown below:

```yaml
stages:
  - name: "dev"
    deployment_strategy: "direct"
    test_strategy: "functional"
  - name: "staging"
    deployment_strategy: "blue_green_service"
    test_strategy: "performance"
  - name: "production"
    deployment_strategy: "blue_green_service"
    remediation_strategy: "automated"
```


This shipyard contains three stages: dev, staging, and production. This results in the three Kubernetes namespaces: sockshop-dev, sockshop-staging, and sockshop-production.

* **dev** will have a direct (big bang) deployment strategy and functional tests are executed
* **staging** will have a blue/green deployment strategy and performance tests are executed
* **production** will have a blue/green deployment strategy without any further testing. The configured remediation strategy is used for the [Self-healing with Keptn](../self-healing-with-keptn/) tutorial.


**Note:**  To learn more about a *shipyard* file, please take a look at the [Shipyard specification](https://github.com/keptn/spec/blob/0.1.3/shipyard.md).

Create a new project for your services using the [keptn create project](../../reference/cli/#keptn-create-project) command. In this example, the project is called *sockshop*. Before executing the following command, make sure you are in the `examples/onboarding-carts` folder.

Create a new project without Git upstream:
```console
keptn create project sockshop --shipyard=./shipyard.yaml
```

**Optional:** Create a new project with Git upstream

To configure a Git upstream for this tutorial, the Git user (`--git-user`), an access token (`--git-token`), and the remote URL (`--git-remote-url`) are required. If a requirement is not met, go to [select Git-based upstream](../../manage/project/#select-git-based-upstream) where instructions for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are provided.

```console
keptn create project sockshop --shipyard=./shipyard.yaml --git-user=GIT_USER --git-token=GIT_TOKEN --git-remote-url=GIT_REMOTE_URL
```
